#NavierStokes
====================

Purpose: a system for synchronizing information between federated social networks.

##Requirements
============

* cliaspora-0.1.7.tgz (Diaspora access) (https://freeshell.de/~mk/projects/cliaspora.html)
** NOTE BENE! You must install a patch to the last release of Cliaspora! The patch
   makes it possible for Cliaspora to post text along with a file upload.
** the patch is part of this package. It is applied as follows:
*** cd cliaspora-0.1.7/
*** patch -p1 < ../navierstokes/cliaspora-file_upload_text-0.1.7.patch
*** make
*** sudo make install
* PyPump 0.5 (pump.io access)
** git clone https://github.com/xray7224/PyPump.git
** cd PyPump
** git fetch
** git checkout v0.5
* cURL (GNU Social access)
* LYNX (for converting HTML to plain text - some social networks don't understand HTML)
* FuzzyWuzzy Python fuzzy text-matching libraries
** https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy
** git clone https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy.git
** cd fuzzywuzzy
** python setup.py install
* FBCMD
** http://fbcmd.dtompkins.com/
** This is needed if you want to bridge to Facebook.

In general, here are the Python libraries needed to make this package operate:

abc
calendar
codecs
commands
copy
fuzzywuzzy
getopt
hashlib
inspect
lockfile
logging
math
os
os.path
pypump
re
requests
subprocess
sys
time
unicodedata
xml.dom.minidom

##Installation
============

1) Unpack the tarball. This automatically creates the navierstokes/ application directory

2) You should create a configuration file for NavierStokes:

~/.navierstokes/navierstokes.cfg

The syntax for the file is explained below.

3) If you intend to bridge between Pump.io and other networks, you must use PyPump to 
register a client (e.g. NavierStokesApp) on Pump.io. Follow their instructions for getting 
the client credentials and tokens. Enter those into the ~/.navierstokes/navierstokes.cfg file (see example below).
PyPump docs: https://pypump.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

4) Make sure Cliaspora is available in the PATH environment variable, or Diaspora interactions
will fail.


##Example navierstokes.cfg file

Be sure to make this .cfg file only readable by you:

> chmod 600 ~/.navierstokes/navierstokes.cfg

##Running NavierStokes

Once you have written a .cfg file (and, if you use pump.io, registered a pump.io client using PyPump), 
you can try executing NavierStokes manually:

> python ./NavierStokes.py 

If you get errors, try tunning in Debug Mode and see what you can learn:

> python ./NavierStokes.py -d

If you get any errors that are unrelated to passwords, logging into, report them to steve@hub.polari.us.
